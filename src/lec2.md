## What Is National Income Accounting?

- A classification of transactions that contribute to national income according to types of expenditure
  - consumption (C): expenditure by consumers
  - investment (I): expenditure by firms
  - government purchases (G): expenditure by gov't, not including transfer payments
  - current account balance (CA): net expenditure by foreigners, exports (EX) $-$ imports (IM)

- **An important identity**
  - national income = expenditure = production

---

## Measuring National Income

- Value of all final goods and services in a given period
  - gross national product (GNP): produced by a nation's factors of production, e.g. labor & capital (our focus)
  - gross domestic product (GDP): produced within a country's borders

- GNP & GDP are approximate measures, but not precise

- A more precise measure
  - net national product (NNP) = GNP $-$ depreciation
  - national income = NNP $+$ net unilateral transfers

---

## U.S. GNP

<img src="images/lec2/Fig1.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

- 2016:Q1, Billions of dollars (source: BEA)
- Consumption is largest component of U.S. GNP

## The Road Ahead

1. [National Income Accounting](#national-income-accounting)
2. [Balance of Payments](#balance-of-payments)

---

## National Income Accounting

**National income identity**

<div class="identity-box">

$$\underbrace{Y}_{\text{GNP}}=\underbrace{C+I+G}_{\text{domestic expenditure}}+\underbrace{EX-IM}_{\text{net foreign expenditure}}$$

$$\Rightarrow\quad\underbrace{EX-IM}_{\text{current account (CA)}}=Y-(C+I+G)$$

</div>

- When production $>$ ($<$) domestic expenditure
  - surplus (deficit): $CA>(<)\ 0\Leftrightarrow EX>(<)\ IM$
  - lending (borrowing) $\Rightarrow$ net foreign wealth $\uparrow$ ($\downarrow$)

- International lending/borrowing $\Rightarrow$ _intertemporal_ trade

---

## U.S. Current Account, 1976-2015

<img src="images/lec2/Fig2.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

- CA & net foreign wealth (or net international investment position), billions of dollars (source: BEA)
- Sustained CA deficits since early 1980s added up to large foreign debt

---

## Saving and Current Account

**National income identity**

<div class="identity-box">

$$\underbrace{S}_{\text{national saving}}=\underbrace{Y-T-C}_{\text{private saving}}+\underbrace{T-G}_{\text{gov't saving}}=\underbrace{I+CA}_{\text{total investment}}$$

</div>

- Some notations
  - $Y-T$ = disposable income, $T$ = taxes net of transfers
  - $S^p$ = private saving, $S^g$ = gov't saving
  - $G-T$ = primary deficit/newly issued gov't debt

- Ways to raise national wealth
  - Closed economy: only accumulate capital ($S=I$)
  - Open economy: also net foreign investment ($CA$)

- Borrow ($CA<0$) to invest more ($I>S$)

---

## Balance of Payments

- A set of accounts recording a country's receipts (credit) from and payments (debit) to foreigners
  - current account = exports $-$ imports $+$ net unilateral transfers of goods and services
  - financial account = sales (exports) of domestic assets to foreigners $-$ domestic purchases (imports) of foreign assets
  - capital account: special transfers of assets (small in quantity), e.g. debt forgiveness, migrants' transfers

- **Principle of double-entry bookkeeping**
  - each transaction enters accounts twice, once as credit ($+$) and once as debit ($-$)
  - current acc't $+$ capital acc't = $-$ financial acc't
