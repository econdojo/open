International economics takes both the micro and macro perspectives to study how nations interact through trade of goods and services, flows of money, and investment. It can be divided into two interrelated subfields: international trade and international finance. This course adopts the macro perspective on international finance and provides analytical tools and formal models to explain, in particular, balance of payments and exchange rate determination. To optimize learning outcomes, this course incorporates artificial intelligence to enhance students' understanding of the world economy. These AI tools provide personalized learning, real-time feedback, and practical application support, preparing students to assess current global economic events.
